9.  Indemnification.
 
(a)  Tech Drone Indemnification.

(i)  Tech Drone shall indemnify, defend, and hold You harmless from and against damages and liabilities as limited in accordance with Section 8 (”Losses”), alleged against You resulting from any third-party claim, suit, action, or proceeding (”Third-Party Claim”) that arises directly from Your use of MultiGame in accordance with these Terms, and alleging that MultiGame infringes or misappropriates a third party’s intellectual property rights, provided that You promptly notify Tech Drone in writing of the Third-Party Claim, cooperate with Tech Drone, and allow Tech Drone sole authority to control the defense and settlement of such claim.
 
(ii)  If such a claim is made or appears reasonably likely to be alleged by a third-party by overt acts of the third-party, as determined solely by Tech Drone, You agree to discontinue use of MultiGame until Tech Drone, using its sole discretion, either (A) modifies or replaces MultiGame, or a component or part thereof, to make it non-infringing, or (B) obtains the right for You to continue use of MultiGame. If Tech Drone determines, using its sole discretion, that neither of these alternatives is commercially reasonable, Tech Drone may immediately terminate these Terms, in their entirety or with respect to the affected component or part, upon written notice to You.

(iii)  This Section 9(a) will not apply if the alleged infringement arises from: (A) use of MultiGame in combination with data, software, hardware, equipment, or technology not provided by Tech Drone; (B) modifications to MultiGame not made by Tech Drone; or (C) use of any version other than the most current version of MultiGame made available to You.

(b)  Your Indemnification. You shall indemnify, hold harmless, and, at Tech Drone’s option, defend Tech Drone and its officers and directors from and against any and all losses, damages, liabilities, costs (including attorneys’ fees) resulting from any Third-Party Claim based on Your or Your Authorized User’s: (i) negligence or willful misconduct; (ii) use of MultiGame in a manner not authorized or contemplated by these Terms; (iii) use of MultiGame in combination with data, software, hardware, equipment or technology not provided by Tech Drone; (iv) modifications to MultiGame not made by Tech Drone; or (v) use of any version other than the most current version of MultiGame made available to You, provided that You may not settle any Third-Party Claim against Tech Drone unless Tech Drone consents to such settlement, and further provided that Tech Drone will have the right, at its option, to defend itself against any such Third-Party Claim or to participate in the defense thereof by counsel of its own choice.

(c)  Sole Remedy. THIS SECTION 9 SETS FORTH YOUR SOLE REMEDIES AND TECH DRONE’S SOLE LIABILITY AND OBLIGATION FOR ANY ACTUAL, THREATENED, OR ALLEGED CLAIMS THAT MULTIGAME INFRINGES, MISAPPROPRIATES, OR OTHERWISE VIOLATES ANY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF ANY THIRD PARTY.

10.  Term and Termination.

(b)  Termination. In addition to any other express termination right set forth in these Terms:

(i)  Tech Drone may terminate these Terms, effective on written notice to You, if You (A) fail to pay any amount when due hereunder, and such failure continues more than thirty days after Tech Drone’s delivery of written notice thereof; or (B) breach any of its obligations under Section 1(b) or Section 5;

(ii)  either You or Tech Drone may terminate these Terms, effective on written notice to the other, if the other materially breaches these Terms, and such breach: (A) is incapable of cure; or (B) being capable of cure, remains uncured thirty days after the non-breaching party provides the breaching party with written notice of such breach; or

(iii)  either You or Tech Drone may terminate these Terms, effective immediately upon written notice to the other, if the other: (A) becomes insolvent or is generally unable to pay, or fails to pay, its debts as they become due; (B) files or has filed against it, a petition for voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy or otherwise becomes subject, voluntarily or involuntarily, to any proceeding under any domestic or foreign bankruptcy or insolvency law; (C) makes or seeks to make a general assignment for the benefit of its creditors; or (D) applies for or has appointed a receiver, trustee, custodian, or similar agent appointed by order of any court of competent jurisdiction to take charge of or sell any material portion of its property or business.

Upon termination, the limited license granted hereunder will also terminate, and, without limiting Your obligations under Section 5, You shall cease using and delete, destroy, or return all copies of MultiGame and certify in writing to Tech Drone that MultiGame has been deleted or destroyed. No termination will affect Your obligation to pay all Fees that may have become due before such termination, or entitle You to any refund.
 
(d)  Survival. This Section 10(d) and Sections 1(b), 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 11 survive any termination or expiration of these Terms. No other provisions of Terms survive the termination.

(c)  Force Majeure. In no event shall You or Tech Drone be liable to the other, or be deemed to have breached these Terms, for any failure or delay in performing its obligations, except for any obligations to make payments, if and to the extent such failure or delay is caused by any circumstances beyond reasonable control, including but not limited to acts of God, flood, fire, earthquake, explosion, war, terrorism, invasion, riot or other civil unrest, strikes, labor stoppages or slowdowns or other industrial disturbances, or passage of law or any action taken by a governmental or public authority, including imposing an embargo.
