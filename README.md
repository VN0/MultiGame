# MultiGame
MultiGame makes game development in Unity fast and simple for artists, programmers, and designers of all stripes!

It works with all other scripts, tools, add-ons. It also has programmer helper functions to improve your Inspector readability or send events in a cleaner and more versatile way than Unity Events without the need for messy delagates.

# Instructions
1. Just open the .unitypackage file and it will open the Unity importer in your project.
2. Click Window -> MultiGame -> Rapid Dev Tool
3. Dock the toolbar on the left or right side of the screen
4. Select an object and click a button to quickly add functionality.

# Editor Tools
You will find several editor tools:
- Rapid Dev Toolbar, contains the most common tools and components
- Prefab Painter, to paint objects onto other objects quickly and easily with many useful settings
- Splines, to place objects procedurally or move them along a procedural path

# Components
You can find many additional components in the Add Component -> MultiGame menu found at the top of the screen, or on the Inspector.
